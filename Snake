PPO Snake AI Report & weights after training

## Intro
This experiment aims to train an artificial intelligence agent to play the Snake game using deep reinforcement learning algorithms(DQN and PPO).The agent(i.e.,the snake)operates within a game environment,with states including the coordinates of the snake's head,the coordinate list of the snake's body,the direction of the snake's head,and the coordinates of the food.The reward mechanism is based on scores for eating food,winning,or losing.The experiment uses the PyGame framework for environment simulation and adjusts reward parameters(such as keeping the reward for eating food constant while gradually increasing the penalty for death)to observe training outcomes.The results show that increasing the penalty for death leads to higher average scores,while a strategy with a lower death penalty performs poorly during training but well in demonstrations.Future work will attempt to optimize the snake's movement by adding penalties for excessive zigzagging and integrating the saved model into a C++framework.

    Have you ever listened to a song and liked it overall, but felt that certain features could be improved? Maybe the chorus was too loud, the energy level wasn't quite right, or there were either too many or too few words. I've had those experiences too, and that's what inspired me to create a song recommender based on user reviews.

    The process is straightforward: simply type in the name of a song or choose a random one, and then enter your review. The recommender will analyze your review using ChatGPT and utilize the Spotify API to generate personalized song recommendations. It's an exciting way to enhance your music discovery and tailor the recommendations to your specific preferences.

    Although it's important to note that the dataset used for training the model was relatively small (170k), the recommender still aims to provide valuable suggestions. While it may not reach its full potential due to the limited data, it serves as a starting point for exploring new songs that align with your individual tastes.

    So, if you're looking to fine-tune your music experience and discover songs that better match your preferences, give this song recommender a try. Enter your review, and let the algorithm work its magic to recommend songs that you're more likely to enjoy.\n

    """
    | Variable | Description |
    | :----: | :---: |
    | Acousticness | A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic. |
    | Danceability | Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable. |
    | Energy | Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy. |
    | Instrumentalness | Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. "Ooh" and "aah" sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly "vocal". The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0. |
    | Key | The key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation. E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1. |
    | Liveness | Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live. |
    | Loudness | The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typically range between -60 and 0 db. |
    | Mode | Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0. |
    | Speechiness | Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks. |
    | Tempo | The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration. |
    | Time Signature | An estimated time signature. The time signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure). The time signature ranges from 3 to 7 indicating time signatures of "3/4", to "7/4". |
    | Valence | A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry). |
